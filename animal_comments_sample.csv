Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel,574727,My dog is quite the handful. I hear my parents talk about getting rid of him. But it makes me break to think of him when we drop him of everyday saying this is the day the are going to come back. This is gonna be the day. And then we never come back. It just absolutely breaks my heart. It would rather keep him until his time is up.

Amethyst Is Cutie,2334730,Give me a shout out
Serpent Sity Exotics,2419456,Unless its an animal that will benefit from captive breeding for conservation purposes I dont like to keep aggressive animals. I like things I can interact with and attitude is totally a thing that passes from parents to offspring so I dont combine cranky animals. Combos/crosses for the sake of it is eh to me. Neat I guess but eh. Its not really something that I find too impressive I guess since a lot of things people cross in captivity cross in the wild too given proper proximity and conditions. Im glad when I see healthy hybrids though tbh because it is easy for hybridized animals to come with a litany of health issues even sometimes with closely related species. I guess Im not a big fan of decorative animals either.  Probably has to do with the fact that I like to help people learn about reptiles and the easiest way to do that is to fill them with positive experience and a snake that doesnt give a crap about being handled and poked is a perfect way to show off how amazing all these different species can be. Ive gotten several people to completely flip their views of reptiles as a whole just by touching one snake for the first time and its heartwarming - all the fear and hate becomes curiosity and wonder. Also because thats just one more person who might possibly become a supporter that endangered species really need to help them thrive again if its possible in the wild.

Since you didnt cure the rock be prepared for algae outbreaks especially the first four months. You have to be very attentive so you dont allow it to take over. I cured for 2 months and still had to deal with algae the first two and a half months. But it will be worth it. I love the look of pukani.

Taylor Nicole Dean,194595,I used to spray down my BP tank but I noticed that once it was sprayed down it only made the humidity worse. Now what I do when the tank is getting a little dry is take Thomas out and let him hang out with me take all of his hides and decor out and then get some warm/semi-hot water and soak his coconut husk in the tank until its damp. Then the humidity goes right up for the next week or two and then you just repeat. Its pretty easy and Thomas will stop hating me for spraying him.Not that youre really doing anything wrong of course! They all look very happy and healthy and gorgeous as ever.
Teresa Bullock,2002947,Teresa sweet lady. Let me applaud your 20+ years of sobriety. That is truly amazing. Yes its a struggle every day but you are choosing to walk away & that is a blessing. There are genetic studies that suggest that a person can be predisposed to addiction but again the choice to start doing drugs is theirs. I do believe addiction is a disease AND a choice. The disease has to do with dopamine receptors in the brain etc. But I do believe it is a *combination* of biological and environmental conditions but the choice to start & stop is ultimately yours. People choose to get high for a variety of reasons but once the addiction takes hold you keep searching for that dopamine high and while it may provide a temporary escape it only makes things worse when you come down. And the viscous cycle starts again. Please remember also that when someone points a finger at you there are 3 fingers pointing back at them. They have no right to judge you. Hold your head high T. It takes a very strong person to go through hell survive and then try to help others not make the same mistake. You are a warrior choosing to put on the right armor. You are the kind of woman that when your feet hit the floor in the morning the devil says Crap! Shes up!  God Bless you always! ✝️💞😘

OTIS FUNKMEYER,1420546,I loved both those battles and it struck me when I first watched them that during the Summer Sessions round although Damen absolutely murdered his set Bouboo seems to have deliberately played with 2 or so layers of the music that Damen didnt. I thought that was really cool because it really struck me as something Bouboo was intentionally doing from the get go as a response to Damens round. In this video I think one clear example is at 3:31 when Bouboo hits the background doom doom doom and also at 3:46 when he hits those fast flowy sounds. Damen as far as I can tell did not dance to those sounds at all and it felt to me like Bouboo used that to demonstrate stronger musicality. But man those battles were sickJust wanted to share! I found that super awesome and it made me rewatch those battles heeaaaaaps

Smarter Every Day 2,2375014,hello Destin!I invited a group of YouTubers to Ozone TN to my aunts home to view the eclipse.out of the dozen and change cameras we had two dedicated cameras set to capture ground waves/shadow bands/shadow snakes on a king size sheet.one of the cameras had a faulty SD card so it missed out on everything... but our second camera was a gopro hero 5 recording in full 4k resolution.the 4k footage is up on my channel at /watch?v=p0shfIRCGLQ(specifically at 2.15 at the start of totality and 5.00 at the end of totality)you can ignore the hangout videos as they tend use some harsh language that you do not use. (the ground waves video has no audio track in the public version)The guys have all given the ok to share all footage we have captured with anyone and i thought you would like to take a look at 4k shadow bands and maybe even use the footage. (we are not looking for video based shoutouts but in description credit for the source of the video would be appreciated)

ViralBe,853938,Have you ever seen Malinois somewhere in the north on the duty? In our country there is sometimes - 20 and - 30 and Belgian Shepherd wont make 24/7 outside. GSD do that. Belgians have way more energy and GSD are BETTER as family dogs. Actually Malinois are one of the worst to have it with kids. Belgians are easier to train for a duty nowadays as are easier to motivate.

Brian Barczyk,731465,What drives me in the morning? That would have to be family and of coarse I live my job. My customers are great. I enjoy getting up and walking into my living room every morning looking at my enclosures to see if maybe I got lucky enough to have a lock between a few of the pairings I put together. I know I am late at doing so but better late than never. So I guess multiple things drive me to get up and going in the morning. As for Speedy I have seen tortoises that have lost limbs with skateboard type things to assist them in everyday life.                   Thanks for vlogging                                            Jess

melevsreef,2288541,So you are thinking about going to verizon. In my mind this is simple I have been with Verizon for over ten years now I have zero complains I pick up the phone and it works bottom line. I notice that you use apple products which is even better. I use apple in my personal life and a droid for work. I can tell you the apple phone works better. All of that being said 7 of the ten years were spent in South East Florida (FT. Lauderdale area) and 3 years ago we moved to Colorado I was concerned about the coverage being in the mountains. I can tell you I still have no complaints I pick up the phone and it works bottom line. it will be worth any extra that you will pay per month. IMHO.

Brian Barczyk,951485,Yep there is always haters they hate because they have problems in their lives so instead of facing these problems they are just mean to others to make them feel better. Sure is a shame! I dont think the shows are bad aslong as the animals are being treated well!

Brian Barczyk,954873,Ive raised snakes for 55 years and 9 years ago when I started my Yoiutube channel there were only around 29 channels about snakes and looking at the thousands of people that show up at the reptile expos gives me great hopes for the future of these amazing animals :) My how weve grown over the past 9 years and I give TOTAL props to everyone out there that has dedicated MANY years to educating people about the reptiles and especially about the snakes and those people already know where they are on the top of my respect list !!
Vet Ranch,1798130,Can anyone help I dont know if my dog needs more food or if its just the breed

CoralFish12g,2334565,George!!!! I enjoy your videos. I recently stumbled across you on YouTube as I was researching for my new hobby in saltwater reef. I then ended up subscribing and binge watching. Lol. I introduced my daughter to your videos because she likes to work with me on the tank. We especially enjoy the college series of vids as she will be going off to school next year and she plans to start her own nano tank. Keep up the good work.
Brave Wilderness,1330416,Not for $1000 but definitely for $10000.

The Dodo,1737106,How heartbreaking. I love animals and it hurts that people can be cruel to these poor helpless animals that don’t know anything but show love and be kind. Literally crying while watching this  I only hope they will get better and learn to trust  and past owners get what they deserve.

Vet Ranch,2220087,Puppies are hard to take care of. Especially that first week or so when they are getting used to being away from their mom and other dogs. I just adopted a little 6 week old chiweenie boy and man... Im so tired. He wakes me up every hour. I did take him outside yesterday and he ran a lot which made him sleep for hours. But now its 4:30 in the morning and I cant do that now. Haha he is so worth it tho I love that moment when he wakes up and cries for me and when I hold him he calms down and nuzzles into me. My heart swells.

Happy Tails,684751,Im so sorry about your opossum I know what its like my dog passed away on Friday.We were going to take him to the vet that day but he passed early in the morning and I dont think the vet could have done anything anyway he was a 13 or 14 year old Shetland Sheepdog he lived a very long and healthy life 12 to 14 to the average for his breed.My mom says she thinks it was heart failure. He was alive before I left for my class that morning I pet him and he seemed to really be in a bad way so I just knew that he wouldnt be making it to the next day. He passed away within the 1-2 hours that I was gone and I found him when got home.I have to say though having other animals there with you when youre going through this is such a blessing I spent hours in my room with one of our cats afterwards.

Brian Barczyk,1198894,For a once in a lifetime opportunity? I would try it but be honest that youre nervous so they can plan for that and know to keep and eye on you because when you are nervous and breathing heavier than normal you will blow through tanks faster if you are using them.

stacyvlogs,2214197,A few years ago my family found a cat wandering outside in our back yard. We decided to try and and make her an indoor cat and it was really hard. I have two other cats so they fought a lot. Keeping the cat(her name was Beth) inside didnt really work so we decided that she was gonna live outside. She still came for meals and slept on our porch and it worked out well!! A few weeks ago Beth started coming back inside and getting used to it again...and shes stayed inside ever since!!!!!

Please send blessings to San Antonio Red Cross for operating a well-organized and hospitable storm shelter system that basically has the whole city plus Rockport and Port Aransas people housed in its school buildings! We are ok and the people from Rockport and Port A are the hardest hit.

Taylor Nicole Dean,1495869,I understand you have great knowledge in caring for the animals you have and that you take good care of them. But I cant  sympathize with your living situation. The only animal you really have out of necessity is your service dog. Part of being responsible for all those animals is taking responsibility for your current living situation caused by caring for so many animals. I really dont think the quality of video is that bad. If you look back into old videos of more popular youtubers. Their video quality was terrible  compared to the videos they put out today. Youre a growing channel things take time. best of luck to you 💙

ViralHog,1846112,yo
weedcat,1079835,Also I think its totally okay if you named your meme social anxiety expect of the fly or else. I think this meme explains social anxiety pretty well and if a meme name makes some people man well thats their problem. Also most memes are literally just named after the name of the song used so I give you a +originality point for naming your meme differently.

Brian Barczyk,2279899,People need to understand something. Brain isnt doing anything wrong. Its nature. If one of those snakes were in the wild and caught a live rabbit to eat people wouldnt bat an eye but because someone is handing the snake the rabbit people get pissed.  Its nature people. Its not like they are live rabbits and brain is standing there watching all creepy. These rabbits feel no pain when the snake is eating them. Its what you gotta do when you own large snakes or any snake in that matter. They need to eat. He does it in one of the most humane ways possible. Cant feed a snake tofu. Hope you have an awesome day Brian.  Thank you for posting your vlogs and teaching people how to love all types of animals.

Brian Barczyk,154672,Quite a few people have already commented Buttercup but I think thats a very fitting name. I also like Dawn and Phoenix means to rise from the ashes reborn. You could also try gemstones that are traditionally (or can be) a similar color as your new burm such as Jasper Amber (I know its not technically a gemstone b4 anyone gets on me) Citrine Tourmaline etc. Im also partial to Champagne. ;) I hope this helps narrow it down even if you dont particularly like any of them! ☺
prehistoricpetstv,524834,Wondering if yall have any video history with the snaklings you have kept to document any color changes which may happen as they grow? I think it would be interesting to see the genetic blends from baby to adult and perhaps discuss genetics for a snake to lighten or darken with age. Thank you

My grandma had a big turtle that she kept in a ten gallon aquarium and put it in a tiny pond that was only about 25-45 gallons in the summer. I never realized until now that turtles need more room than that and a basking spot. I will look out for that stuff even though Im only a kid.

Horses do not have nearly as good of footing on concrete and they think differently. When you ride your horse on the road like that your putting their life in danger and thats not okay because they dont have a choice or a voice to say no I dont want to go.

Think Like A Horse,1474124,You should see all the nasty comments I got when I spoke out against barrel racers. I asked why so many of them flip over with their riders or come into the arena rearing and bucking and I was told  barrel racers treat their horses like their kids the rider was probably trying out new tack the horse might have had a tooth problem it was a new horse and then my favorite youre just dumb. If all these barrel racers claim they dont yank on the bit or starfish or beat their horses with quirts then where the hell do all these videos come from? People are just so desperate to justify horse abuse because they dont want to admit that what they are doing is wrong.

At first I thought it was jealousy (it could still be) but now Im not sure. She attacks him basically out of nowhere. They could be fine and suddenly she goes after him; she has cut him and bitten his ears. Im a little worried Ive seperated her from him various times but I really dont know what to do and would appreciate your help. Thanks!

Think Like A Horse,1268659,That was good on your part and no ranting yah.  You are here to suggest what could go wrong. and I was thinking the same thing. if this thing looked like a toy he may have picked it up to shake it like the horse with the rubber ducky. we dont know the situation but others who are just stupid would let the horse go further and baby could be injured badly. just because baby is in a car protection seat doesnt make it safe. Like a helmet gives the illusion you will be safe. as for me and my helmet I use it to be sure when a fail happens I might be safe. I know its only an illusion and work as if I didnt have one.

DELETING MY CHANNEL BTSTT93 Sorcerers [28.7.2017],2342689,jhpoe neck
Brave Wilderness,2099994,To clarify why I love this channel I will point out some of the things that I love ABOUT the channel. For starters this channel always excites me with every episode they put out. Running into a mother bear with her cubs is very intriguing. In fact the effort the team puts into their videos is fascinating. Taking hour after hour day after day to capture a fish in frigid waters is not an easy task. The difficult work that goes into these recordings is fascinating. I would love to be one of the first to read your book because reading has always been a hobby of mine. Having an opportunity to be one of the lucky few who get chosen for a book that is signed by my inspiration would be my dream. Thanks for the opportunity. -Tyler

Creative Pet Keeping,8814,I had Discus years agos when I Iived with my parents  that would come to the front glass of the aquarium whenever they saw me or someone they liked from very far away.And they would all go and hide whenever they had a glimpse from far away of peope they didnt like like one of my sisters boyfriend who liked to poke them.I dont know for bettas I had some and always sensed cleverness in them Im guessing they might be smart fish too like cichlids are and might be able to tell whos this human behind the glass.They watch us as much as we watch them !

Think Like A Horse,979123,Hi...I tell folks to never use mineral oil...which is in your M-T-G...made from petroleum.  If you cant eat it...dont put it on your skin...or your horse dog etc.  You can create your own mixture use calendula in olive oil for a terrific healing mixture.  For bugs and fungal...use the tea tree geranium rosemary eucalyptus oil dilluted in coconut or olive oil.  Chlorhexidine is nasty...will kill natural skin immunity...I wouldnt touch it!

Brother K,2236983,Appearance conformity is the primary but seldom spoken reason why routine infant circumcision remains common in the USA. Theres no way in hell my son will go through life with a weird and disgusting dick!!The medical pretexts for circumcision are merely rationalisations.I know of no good data on the prevalence or RIC in the USA today. HHS has all USA hospitals fill out an annual questionnaire that includes the questions how many babies of each gender were born in your maternity ward? and how many routine infant circumcisions were performed in your hospital?. Thus we know that in 2012 55% of boys born in USA maternity wards underwent RIC. But a growing fraction of boys are circumcised as outpatients in the office of a pediatrician. HHS does not count such circumcisions. Circumcision after infancy is relatively uncommon.

Brave Wilderness,1051195,AAAA NEW VİDEO
Gone to the Snow Dogs,1116324,One of our dogs started getting bumps too a few years ago.  At first thy were usually just cysts or fatty lumps but they started showing up more and more frequently either around his eyes or paws buts sometimes on his  butt shoulders or legs.  It got to the point where we felt like we were just chasing bumps even when we would go in to have a bump or two removed and they would find others we had missed.    And while we left a few small ones alone we started having ones come up that were abnormal although not cancer they were suspicious for changes that pathology does not like to see and then some of the ones we left alone the cells started to change too - so we had them all removed.  Then after a  bit a few more popped up.  Our vet suggested that since they all seemed to start as fatty lumps and then change we might want to consider Curcumin (which is also known as Tumeric which is a spice in curry) that has been shown to reduce fatty lumps once formed and help prevent new ones.  We started him on it 2 years ago and it was not immediately a fix as it takes a while to do its thing but after 4 months on it he stopped making and new bumps and after 2 more months some of the bumps he had started to get smaller.  Now 2 years later while he still has 2 very small ones they have not gone totally away - but have not changed to abnormal either he has stopped producing new ones which is good as his eye were getting pretty irritated having bumps removed every few months  I just order a big bottle of it (95% Cucuminoids) from amazon and give him 2 capsules a day.  Maybe worth a try with Shelby?

The Dodo,1221444,It’s not all people do this stuff. Additionally a 40 square foot stall is a pretty big stall for a horse. And a 9 hour shift for one horse pulling a cart is pretty hard but that can easily fixed if the trainers get a cart that allows 2 horses to pull them or switch them at regular intervals. As well If you think it is cruel to whip if it wouldn’t go is like kicking it sides I won’t disagree that some people abuse the animals but that doesn’t mean that all trainers do it.

They knew that traffic would be AWFUL for him so they let him leave first. It took him 37 hours to get home. We live 15 at the most and it took my husband 2 hours. Youd think theyd learn not to let every government employee or at the exact same time (noon) but no... the very next year they did the exact same thing. At least the people who had to do the driving had food water blankets and called anyone they knew of that was even 5 min closer than their house was and stayed there overnight!

They are both worthy of all our praise.  I am loving this gingerbread house too. The snow was inspired. Both around the windows and on the roof. And where did you get the stuff on the floor? Might I suggest a temporary velcro to the floor so you dont have to keep putting it back for the video. Just a thought.

I was going to get a younger bunny until I went to a rabbitry and learned that 2 years of age and older are better because the younger rabbits will have a certain attitude at 2 months and stay that way until they reach 2 years old and get spayed/neutered. Should I be getting a younger holland lop or a older holland lop?

HammyLux,2115263,I just adopted my first hamster last week! I went into Pets at Home (I guess the UK equivelant to Petsmart) and fell in love with a syrian named Bear. He had been there for 5 months at least and nobody wanted him so he was up for adoption. I couldnt stop thinking about him all week so I went back on Wednesday gathered my supplies and went to talk to a shop assistant and told her I was looking to adopt Bear. Oh no... he was adopted already! He was picked up just a couple of hours ago! I meeeean.. what are the chances! So upset. Glad he eventually got a home though! I had a look at the other hammies they had for adoption though and fell in love with a gorgeous pale tan sorta colour girl who I called Rosie :) happy endings all round!

dzlfreek,640273,They dont know if your a smart responsible guy or a guy who is going to burn the neighborhood down. You can have a cooking fire. Having a hose nearby helps. The guys that showed up werent disrespectful or rude. The hours are so if you do burn it down they can fight it in the daylight. The permit lets them know if they get a call to your area that you are burning and its probably not a real emergency so they can respond normally not lights and sirens. I can at least relate to it being frustrating but as usual a couple of idiots burning down the neighborhood have changed the rules for everyone.

RaleighLink14,954618,How DISGUSTING. This makes me absolutely SICK. Horses are not cars or vehicles you CANT push them and push them over their breaking point! Everyone agrees that slavery is a horrible thing working people to death is SO WRONG! IF WORKING PEOPLE TO DEATH IS SO WRONG THEN WHY DO THEY THINK ITS OKAY TO WORK AN ANIMAL TO DEATH?! They are living breathing beings not some freaking machine. They need breaks just like us. They have limits just like us. If you are one to support this racing sport please come to your senses and realize that this is absolutely 100% not okay at all.

Brandon,1413812,Im  jealous that you have all those old Mcdonalds toys. I had plenty of them plus so many real ones Between my sister and I we had at least one hundred TY beanie babies and the buddies. We were obsessed with them. Now I only have a few left. My mom threw away my absolute favorite one back in 2012 when she sold her house. That was a bit hard because it had some special significance to me but she didnt know that. Speaking of them them though - when my cat was a kitten she dragged upstairs from the basement all the beanie buddy cats that I had. It was so strange but funny. We didnt think it was really likely a cat could recognize a stuffed cat as a fellow feline we think she just really liked the long tails - but it made us laugh anyway as she didnt touch any of the other non cat ones.

Brave Wilderness,754261,Hey Coyote! My two daughters can’t wait for your new episodes. They love to play “Coyote Peterson” in our backyard. One is you and the other is the “Coyote R U Ok?” Camera crew. They film small videos around our yard mostly finding bugs and describing them. The best they ever found was two turtles. I think they would love to take turns using the backpack when they play “Coyote Peterson”! They may not get to use it for grand adventures but I think it would be worth it to see them wearing it in their little videos. Thanks always for the fun videos for the kids. I know I can trust them on your channel. Be Brave! Stay Wild!

PetDogTricks,1082553,Hi. This might seem like a dumb question from a novicein the eyes of budgie experts. But I have had to learn a lot in a short time. One. The little parekeet I take care for my old sick father has been alone basically for weeks save for short feeding visits from the neighbour until I could get there. Now I dont like leaving her alone for more than 4-5 hours at at a time. So I leave the cage door open in the living room and put on clips luke this for her. I wonder how being alone for so long effects her and whether these bird sounds have a calming effect while Im gone. Any budgie owner with some pointers is appreciated.

The Truth in Story,582895,My favorite crayon color was turquoise blue. It is still in my favorite color family. When I was about 9 years old I wanted to paint my walls turquoise blue. My mom allowed me to pick the color and I chose the brightest turquoise of all the choices. My mom warned me that it would be to bright and that I would not like it but I insisted that I would love it. We painted the walls my color and I hated it. It was so loud and overwhelmingly bright that I felt physically ill being in my room. My mom made me keep it for what felt like forever. I spent little time in my room until it was repainted. This experience led me to love softer more pastel or vintage shades of color. If I had to choose now I would choose the sea green crayola.

Brian Barczyk,2500996,When I was a kid my best friends dad had a koi pond in his yard. It was a really hot summer. Each of the koi were worth around 1k. They all floated to the top so we thought they were dead. They werent moving. My buddy threw them in the garbage bag and buried them. We got in so much trouble. Apparently they werent dead. Koi just do that when its too hot. I still feel terrible. Before internet days so info was hard to find. Dont bury floating koi in the summer.

Exploring Alabama,1064513,The very first thing you showed us you said maybe some type of hinge is a wedge used on concrete forms. Your grabber thing if you put Plastidip on the fingers of it then it should have better grip. Plastidip comes in a liquid or spray and very handy to have around. Good video and as always when I am on my way to do something I shouldnt check to see if you posted something.

pecktec,1097669,Thats a heck load neater than my first attempt at a mattenfilter!  Though it was my first tank and my first choice of filtration.  ran my 60L tank for a year with minimal water changes and everything thrived in it. :)  Though i just used an airpump attached to the jetlift.
Bulkreefsupply.com - Saltwater Aquarium Supplies,163257,Thanks for the update.  I switched to Triton when I upgraded to my RSR 250 from my 24g cube on August 31st where I had been using the Red Sea Reef Care Program.  I find things going well and I really like the simplicity of dosing the 4 part.  I did have some things not opening well but attributed it to the tank move.  I did my alkalinity lowering I was running at around 10 with the RS program to 8.  Nice to hear that the instability was to be expected.  I am using the Hydra 26s with the tank on the AB+ Mimic setting that you shared a few weeks ago.  My fuge is a bit small having DIYs it within the sump but using the Tuna Flora has been great.  Using Chaeto Dragons Breath and even have 10 mangroves in there for fun.  I was really glad to be able to thank you guys in person at RAP a few weeks ago.  You have made my reefkeeping experience so enjoyable and rewarding.

Hell in 2017 *black people* are more racist toward *whites* than vice versa because of leftist fear mongering. Because Trump is a racist bigot right? Yet... every single US citizen has the exact same rights as they did under Obama.*Every* single sane person knows that racism is wrong.

Frosted Forest Sasquatch - Alabama Bigfoot Investigations,1116692,Im so glad you posted this. It helped me understand how close you are to these incredible people. I totally get what you said! And I always thought knocking on trees was a bad idea since we really dont know what theyre trying to communicate. Im glad youre still playing your guitar for them. I think thats an extraordinary way to get them interested in you. Have you seen the YouTube videos of people playing instruments near a cow pasture and the cows all come to listen? Music really is the universal language and it must sound mind blowing to the Bigfoot. I love that youre having such a great relationship with them. Keep doing what youre doing! Ill always watch (or listen to) what you post! Thanks

But we still keep the dumb little puppy mouthed babies as pets and boop their snoots. They can be extremely dangerous but when tamed can be cuddly little noodles that get stuck in your hair and lick your face.

ViralHog,95111,People in the comments of animal vids always preaching their hatred of humanity for the wonder of animals but wild animals constantly seek aid from people when they are hurt or need dire help. I guess all the animal nuts are right the animals are smarter than some of us. They have more faith in humanity than the nuts do.

Im pretty sure they all did fine though

Shamama Hunting Owl,1327254,Hi ShamamaI love your readings and thank you <3. My twin journey is a little different....My Dm has been unjustlyunfairly and cruelly imprisoned since Sept. Its devastating.We are appealling it!!!! That is the karmic partner it is a situation. I stay faithful and with divine faith that he will come home soon. All we have is our spirituality in communication and letters..and rare visits. Ive been having a very hard time with this...lost alot of energy with all these court battles for over 2 years...wounded warriortrying to regenerate but in baby steps...I normally bounce back fast with fire and strengthbut Im exhausted and I miss him so deeply...we have had our very painful relationship struggles thru 3 yrs...but I am still for him 100% and thank you for the helpful words about not forcing him to heal. My letters are encouraging and helpful to him thoughto keep him stronggood and righteous...Im nervous he will absorb all the bad energy in there...but I must have faith that the divine knows what it is doing and just stay his support...while trying to bounce back from feeling defeatedspent and lost.

rsdfreetour,2507910,I think that the whole yay competition and capitalism is so great meme seems pretty fuckin rich coming from the co founder of a company that tries to legally prevent its former instructors from teaching pickup on their own. Dont non-compete clauses strike you as a tad.... anti competitive??  To be fair this clause might not have been Tylers idea whatsoever but the overall point still stands. RSD should either offer a better service than Todd or fucking suck it up if it loses students to him. But if it wants to prevent a potentially better alternative for students  from coming into existence through a litigious route.... do what you gotta do to survive but then it cant claim that its priority is wanting the best for its students and Tyler shouldnt preach about competition. I think thats fair.

Think Like A Horse,884229,I love that u read Confucius quotes. I worked ( sadly) within the  harness racing industry Very big in nz. In this time horses taught me more about my self than any bloody self- help book could.The people (most) taught me what NOT to do . I watched i learned. I thort naively i could sneak a few ideas in here and there. I learnt those horses didnt like mouthing. I learnt they were sore 10 times out of 9.I hate bits I loath the overcheck bit or chin strap.  Shoes. Weaning . Old school  ideas they use here  because thats just how its done.  I also learnt u can teach an old dog new trick. Some changes were made.On a perfect frosty morning with a horse especially relaxed and having a jog in cart day. i learnt that there was  beauty in a horse enjoying just doing what he was bred for and those were the days i really learnt from. Ill never stop learning about me and the horse. Thank you for being you . We appreciate it.

278pikelk,1546434,If then you were raised with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things above not on things on the earth. For you died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who  is  our life appears then you also will appear with Him in glory. Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication uncleanness passion evil desire and covetousness which is idolatry. Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them. But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy language out of your mouth. Do not lie to one another since you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcised nor uncircumcised barbarian Scythian slave nor free but Christ is all and in all. Therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved put on tender mercies kindness humility meekness longsuffering; bearing with one another and forgiving one another if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you so you also must  do.  But above all these things put on love which is the bond of perfection. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God the Father through Him.Colossians 3:1‭-‬17 NKJV

It is still not my favorite TV show and it probably never will be but I can enjoy it just not as much cause I really dont like Clace here :( they are annoying me most of the time.If u like to read Jay u really should check the books. Not just TMI but ID also its one of my most favorite book series ever (just love main characters in that one 😍).

Thor Unleashed,20853,Thor the Magnificent! Yet so gentle and sweet at the same time. Have you considered selling a tshirt featuring Thor? I bought one featuring Nora in the leaf pile obviously one with Thor would be most welcome. It could go toward a moving fund or whatever you prefer. Just saying. I like the idea of huskies their owners and YouTubers taking over Alpena! And I know the Deli would be a major hangout. Your videos are so relaxing and enjoyable. I am particularly grateful you do not have the same intro and ending song on each and every video. It is impossible for me to skip the intro on other channels (they all have various lengths so I just lower the volume and deal with it) I do stop the videos at the end in order to avoid the same music time-&-again. After the first few times I hear the same music I am pretty much over it. I ceased watching most channels with so much repetitive music thus far the only exceptions are GTTSD Snow Dogs Vlogs and Press Record.

Think Like A Horse,420458,the joke- ey should be banned from all horse activities and events! He got caught on CCTV and out in public!  Rick your 1000% correct! this is the first time I have mentioned this I worked a week at a racing stable.  it was treated as a business.  ( dont worry folks the stable is gone).  the horses at some stables are treated as things to make money. I had seen a winner who was in the money as soon as he was beyond his term of winning. they contacted a meat hauler to take him for slaughter.  of all the horses there he was the most calmest.( they rather see him go for burger than be a kids pet). I could go on but ..

Brave Wilderness,1532784,I love your channel because I never get to travel ( only once when I was 2) so I get to see the world. I Also love it because I love animals  but also fear some of them. Your channel helps me get over my fear and get me interested in new things( right now it is photography). I want the backpack because I am in scouts( even though Im a girl but whatever) and we always go camping  hiking traveling and sometime this year canoeing. Having a backpack like that for a day pack would be very helpful to hold all the things I need for my adventure. My family also owns a large area of land and I love to explore there( I even found a frog in the field by the bog) . I would love the knife because I have a knife permit( from scouts)  I use knives for various things such as fire making ( feather sticks and bits of kindling and shavings) cutting rope or branches whittling and cutting things open . I would like the socks I guess they wont fit me but whatever. Socks are cool😜. I also want the book because my country was not one of the ones included for your tour. I had no chance of getting there since I dont travel and I dont have any relatives in those countries either. I wish I could win the give away. It would mean so much to me if you picked me for the give away

Brave Wilderness,1581833,Hey Coyote! The reason I should get one of your books is that i have been a pack member for a very long time and when I have nobody to play with or talk to I watch your channel and feel like Im on the adventures with youeven though Im in Canada but that doesnt stop my imagination. And its totally ok if I dont get picked I wont mind. And thats why I would very much appreciate getting one of your books not because its free but because you wrote it and put so much time into it and a book like that should go into the right hands where someone will cherish it and love it.

The old owner claimed to not want her back truly shows that they just wanted to abandon her and wanted her dead. However they were shocked to find out that she is still alive just to dump her again.

Brian Barczyk,1124446,Brian you need to start collaborating more with your subscribers and less with these other youtubers. I want you to innovate instead of just doing what the rest of the vlogers do. You want 1m subs? Then change it up. I live within spitting distance of PP out in Fountain Valley and every time you come out it’s impossible to see you. Shows visits I’ve tried them all. Do something and invite subscribers. They bring in friends and bam you have more subs. You have a winning formula by-in-large but push the limits and see what happens.

Mr. Max T.V.,1789302,Question: I see some birds with frequent postings that are banded and some not. Why the difference? LN
TobyTurner,1262218,People are going to judge you because they think that seeing you every day on YouTube means they have rights in your life at the end of the day you know whats real and whats important and if you dont then you will at some point hopefully. I find your videos entertaining and can see that its how you let your emotions out remember that the majority of people who watch your videos WANT to watch them and those that watch them to put ridiculous/hurtful comments arent worth your time or worry. Keep on keeping on dude....

camelsandfriends,1631093,I took in an orphaned dog(her mom when she was 3 weeks old) in a foreign island country populated by semi feral/ feral dogs. Shes just over 3 months old now. Thinking about issues like this makes me question whether I did the right thing bringing her back with me to the US instead of releasing her back into the woods. Its not natural. Ill have to get her spayed and subject her to unnatural pain and hormonal imbalance. She would have died had i not found her but I feel sick taking this wild creature out of her jungle home and modifying her to be a companion.

AnimalBytesTV,1448539,Brian We missed your vlog this morningbut watching you every morning on any channel is great .With your partner company you should produce items such as skink chow and reptile chips or dried fruit nibbles and kibbles.You could also sell accessories for pets like harness leashes for lizards. Your logo on any animal product would sell but I know you wouldnt put your name on anything that wasnt a quality item.Theres more than bedding that a pet needs .This is where bugs and such would be good to find in a food product .🐸👌😋Bugs  vegetable and or fruit in a pelletnugget or chip form with all the nutrients your reptile needs.Just an idea .Looking forward to seeing the vlog tomorrow.Maybe we could go for a walk about soon and look for snakes in the wild .I think something outdoors once a week ( if possible ) might be a pleasant change .Remember your vlog is visual educational and entertaining so its an interesting idea..Thanx so Till tomorrow...🐍🐍🐍🐢🐸🐊🐲🐉🌴🐛🐜🐞🐝🐌🌵🌱🌿🌹🌸🌼🌻🌺🌞🌚 🍓🍒🍠🍌🐾🐾👋👍✌🙋

Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel,2119201,The only thing that I find disturbing about these dog rescues is when Eldad addresses the dog with its ok over and over in a loud and excitable tone. I would think that a softer more soothing and gentle tone would make the dog calm down after hearing a supportive voice and not hysterical yelling IMHO. Otherwise Hope for Paws is an awesome dog rescue organization that should be supported. I did.

Nichole337,1639975,Good job Nicole. You sing much better than you did back then. You are actually making progress. However you are still not on par with the true singers. You need to try harder to modify your tone of voice to a singing voice rather than a talking voice but I can see you are already improving on that. Try taking some singing lessons if you havent already. Study musical theory its not that hard. This is so that you can write your own songs one day when you are a good enough singer rather than just doing cover songs. Most importantly keep practicing!

Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel,2191950,i took a stray cat from school months ago. he suffered malnutritio hes so thin and weak. he didnt eat much and when i took him home he got diarrhea hes so weak and one day when i went back from school he cant even stand from his sand box his liquid poop covered his body i was so sad :( but i gave him yolk and soya bean i had to use my printer injection because he didnt want to eat anymore that night when i placed piece of meat he ate ! i was so happy and before i went to school i placed food near him i also asked my dad to give him more if he ate that food. omg he ate much that day and hes fully recovered now :) i named him bingo when i rescued him but when he got weaker i changed his name to dudut dudut means fatty in indonesian 😆 and hes so fat and lazy now. he also befriended with another cat now i have 2 cats the others name is ducil which means dudut kecil or small fatty 😂 i love them so much i am faraway from them because i go to college this year but they always stick to me when i come back home because my mom hate cats actually she only feed them because of me she never give them love but at least she feeds her 😪

Ted Judy,31204,Scape looks amazing I know the pain of having a tank leak after investing a bunch of time into it.  Had a 72 gallon bowfront blow out the front lower seal about a week after scaping and cycling.  Luckily hadnt added fish yet but had to pick up a spare 10 gallon tank to keep the plants and filter bacteria alive while I figured out what to do.  Ended up getting a brand new 75 gallon much happier with the flat glass so I guess it all worked out in the end.  Looking forward to an update on this tank.

Brave Wilderness,541852,I would like to win because currently i am going around to different countrys alot and i tend to wonder off in search of different types of animals ( ive seen some odd ones ) but still amazing in their own ways. having a decent pack and a good knife would be handy but the soaks sound like the best item in the give away lol. i love this channel because it teaches me more about animals however scares me to death when you get stung. i have never been strung before so it scares me to think what if i do. its hard to get sting kill where i am or maybe just not common in my area lol.

Viktor Larkhill,1358915,Poor poor little thing. I cant donate today but next week when I get my next pay I will. He is such a brave little mite. Reminds me of Carmen in away because hes got those adorable pleading eyes and yet he takes so much pain from people jabbing him and moving him about and he doesnt cry and squeal with pain. Hes so very brave. My guess with that many fractures it had to be one hard hit from a car OR more than one car. Perhaps he was thrown out of a moving vehicle. Just re-read what you wrote. the patrol saw him being thrown by the side of the road. How cruel. Give Peanut lots of kisses and hugs from all of us on here.

Think Like A Horse,889920,This man has asked for help which is a brave thing to do. Rick is giving him a positive critique (in his style). The great thing about horses is when you change what youre doing wrong to doing it correctly then the horse changes too they are so forgiving (unlike humans!) We all have to learn how to do things properly with horses but it takes a very long time and a lot of practice. Teaching a horse is a process not an event.

Dogumentary TV,1873643,have you thought of doing a video on pugs ?
Adigun Forest,1617285,I saw that video where he was going in on that guy about the Black Panther trailer. A lot of what Jason Black says can be debunked if you take your time and do your research. Its not easy to do it on his platform IN REAL TIME because he will cut you off and talk over you to PURPOSEFULLY disrupt your thinking process. All you have to do is is do a well-researched ARTICULATE point by point breakdown of the subject matter ON YOUR OWN VIDEO and put it out there and challenge him to debunk it. Its that easy. I would recommend doing a split-screen format where you play what he says on one side and then counter his argument VERBALLY on the other while showing VISUAL PROOF. Actually Im going to do it in the future.

Brian Barczyk,2505562,Thanks for sharing your trip and all the amazing things with us. Your vlogs have been absolutely great so far and I cant wait to see more. Sometimes criticism is great and necessary but in this case with your trip it is uncalled for because it is an experience and you have to take the good with the bad. We should all be able to understand what you condone and what you dont. Ive given you some crap before but it was from the heart and I felt it was important to you your vlog and your philosophy. The haters just freak out or hate with no good reason or any logical sense. Keep up the great work Brian listen to the right people ignore the idiots! = )

I also remember the huge cardboard bricks you can make forts with. The closest I had to playing with legos was an off brand my grandparents had for us. I also remember wood blocks we could use to build things but never legos.  Legos were always to expensive for my parents to get.

REALITY TALK REVIEWS,1706127,I hate people my age that think theyre the center of the universe. No one can be wrong anymore or else they flip out and get triggered. My buddy almost snapped on me because I said something wrong about his hobby and he acted like I was saying I knew better and was right which I totally wasnt. I dunno I highly dislike dealing with people my age.
Peter Caine Dog Training,2368566,Very simple. If it is real as you claim? All you have to do is send a postage stamp sized piece of flesh and a few hairs to Dr. Meldrum whose address is listed below (from TBJJ24s post) and while he (or no one else for that matter) cant tell you its DNA from a Bigfoot he can tell you its from an UNKNOWN primate This will confirm to all that youre not just a hoaxing piece of shit with a foul mouth.To me there is no better way for you to say IN YOUR FACE! you skeptics!  Otherwise its not looking good for your claims of veracity.

Brave Wilderness,2158799,Being sprayed by this little fellas is the worst. I got sprayed by one on my way to work. It was snowing so bad I was using an umbrella. Walked all the way back home smelling like...I dont know how to describe it. Even the umbrella was all sticky and stinky. I had to tell my boss I was missing work because I was sprayed by a skunk. Went to work next day after spending a whole day scrubbing the stink off. I was the joke of the day but wasnt paying much attention because that stuff from the skunk went also into my nose and I smelled it for a few more days.....thats little encounter with urban wildlife.

GOOD BYE,2231440,I like this arc so far(spoiler comment)... Except the way Gohan was forced into a draw because of a plot device to drive the episode.That cocky Kai of universe 9 got served good.  I liked his reaction when the beans were spilled about Gokus folly.  Beerus going face to face with the Supreme Kai getting owned because they were both lazy and idiotic.

Think Like A Horse,2394737,Horses kick because its a reflex. Theyre not trying to be mean .Its like when you go to the doctors and they take that hammer like tool and tap your knee. You uncontrollably kick out because they are testing for your reflex.  Now what if your doctor was stupid and tested your knee while standing in front of you and you accidentally kick him. Same thing with people and horses.

Coyote Trapping School,103076,I like how you put up your stats. I just started trapping last season. I think on the same size property from Jan. thru Feb. I caught 10 skunks 14 possums 35 raccoons 2 red fox 5 coyotes on about 16 coil springs and 12 dog proofs (no beaver or otter sets). I was a little surprised I didnt catch a gray fox though. I was a little surprised by the somewhat low coyote numbers (#1 targets) and cams showing my misses. Its foolish to think I could get em all I suppose.I empathize with you cuz my wife said youre either hunting or trapping next year but not both haha.

Paws Channel,1940912,These ASSHOLES always trying to kill the leopard and these cunts wonder why they attack. Heeesan a idea INSTEAD of trying to kill the leopard try to catch the leopard and release ir back to the wild. Karma is TRYING to tell you halfwits that the more you go against nature and try kill leopards and other Animals the more negative Karma you will bring upon your village. STOP killing Animals and if one happens to pose a threat than catch it and REALEASE the Animal back into the wild. SIMPLE EASY SOLUTION YOU UNDERSTAND???????????? 😨

RaleighLink14,2497739,I know you werent hating on Maya you made that very clear but you only talked about 1 minute of footage in a 7-10 minute video. Maya also said (and I know you said something about this) that shes in college and does not have time for a horse. And she also cant find someone that wants to half lease her out. Its a very good thing that Maya admits not not having time wouldnt you rather Luna get sold to a rider that is going to give her the care and attention she needs all the time? Not just when Maya can go out every blue moon. This is Mayas second year oh college so it is very obvious that she has tried to keep Luna( like you said). She also said that she is having financial issues Im assuming its not just Maya but her parents as well. Now I know youve said this is other videos but if someone cant financially care for a horse why have one? Its not right to the horse. Maya has very good reasons to sell Luna its not Maya being selfish its her thinking ahead making sure Luna doesnt go to waste and gets the care and love she deserves and needs. Luna is the kind of horse thats always needs to be doing someone to keep her occupied. Being ridden maybe once or twice a week if that is not good for Luna.

Brave Wilderness,455284,Hi CoyoteAs someone who aspires to be a herpetologist I truly love this channel. With every new video comes the thrill of a wild exploration and captivating creatures (as well as a healthy dose of Coyote humour). This informative engaging channel really has broadened my knowledge and has helped me secure in my mind that a career in biology is really what I want to do. I enter my final year of school next year (my next big adventure - adulthood) and while I plan to set myself into study I also plan to go out into the wilderness on many wildlife expeditions. I live in Australia and so this particular pack would be immensely helpful on my trips around the more extreme locations that Australia has to offer. I really hope to win but in any case I really want to thank you - Coyote Mark and all the rest of the Brave Wilderness crew - for all of the effort you put into wildlife education and keeping the Coyote Pack smiling.

SlideShow ForFun,2177165,so some people are perfectly fine with deciding to not have a dog anymore?!? I wonder if they are the same way with children? these dogs dont have a choice. I feel so bad for abandoned dogs! some people have no clue how much that hurts the dog. they love you UNCONDITIONALLY! I rescued a dog from a shelter. he was a pitbull that was raised to fight! when I went to see him he had cuts and scars all over his face. the shelter didnt even want to let me see him because he was vicious. the shelter told me they were going to youthinize him the next day. he was very mean and wouldnt let anyone near his cage. I still wanted to see him. when I walked close to his cage he sat in front of the door and put his paw on the door and just looked at me like he knew I was there for him! they said they would only take him out to see if he would be a good match for me with those polls with the rope on the end. I sat in the little area where you get to see the dogs and waited. when they brought the dog to see me he walked right over to me and sat down and put his head on my knee and just looked at me. that was enough for me to take him home. he turned out to be one of the best dogs I ever had. we completely changed eachother. I could walk him anywhere without a leash and he would see other dogs and stay right with me as if when he was with his previous owner he was forced to fight and didnt want to!

REALITY TALK REVIEWS,867306,Alot of Toys now a days suck compared to what we used to have. Action figures are clunky and overpriced...etc. I always loved Toys R Us. Hell I worked there while I was in High School. They missed the marked with their electronics department. Walmart usually sucks when it comes to toys. Yeah they have some but not the variety. I dont really see Toys R Us commercials like we used to have either. Maybe its just my area...anyway I hope they survive this. Lots of jobs on the line too.

Rachel Oleary,520704,Wild v farmed has always been the one element of the hobby Ive struggled with most.  As far as I know all the fish Ive bought up to now have been bred in captivity and my attitude has been that I wouldnt knowingly buy a wild caught fish but I hadnt considered the very valid buy a fish save a tree argument so I might not be so quick to reject the idea of buying something wild caught in future.   Thanks for making such an interesting and thought-provoking video. 😊

Brave Wilderness,1245291,I want the book
RaleighLink14,1821689,Raleigh can I just say that I usually look up to you. I normally agree with most things that you say but with this video I feel kinda disappointed. Jordan is genuinely a really good rider and I feel that people were over reacting slightly over this video. The Shetland doesnt appear to be struggling to move at all and I think that the abuse and words that came from your mouth over this situation was a little immature. Also when you referred to it as a relationship were 95% of the time everything was fine and then 5% of the time you were being beaten whipped etc was out of order. Youre basically saying that Jordan beats and abuses this horse which is obviously not true. Most of the time I look up to you and I agree with most things that you say and feel the same way you do over a lot of issues but somehow I feel like this wasnt right. 😕
The Dodo,61979,Dude your balls are way bigger than mine!!! Right on!!! I think that snakes in love!!!

Think Like A Horse,2236640,Observing this behaviour in Buddy and Mr T  with their needs for safety food and security satisfied is impossible. Buddy would never bite or kick Rick he just observes him to see if hes walking over to the food store. The joys of an aged relationship with equines its easy  when you treat them well. equine-equine interactions are far different from human-equine interactions.
Keedes channel LIVE,2161757,вау😎☺
Think Like A Horse,983895,Just in a little bit off a defense of whats happening in this video in some places there are packs of feral dogs so feral that they actually act violently towards humans and evens hunt adults children other pets and other dogs wolves coyotes and any other animal they desire. This has gotten so out of hand that even though I try to stand by animal rights as much as possible I support the concept of putting them down it sounds harsh but these wilds dogs are so irrational and dangerous that a catching operation would be to risky. Whether or not this is whats happening in this video Im not sure to me this dog actually seems like it may be playing but since there is a pack Im not to sure.

Think Like A Horse,137676,Im w/ you Rick !   Spending $$ doesnt prove your love or compassion and certainly doesnt insure results !!   a.)    with technology today and the ability to connect w/ an overwhelming knowledge pool globally (as long as you critically sift through the info.) you can learn just about anything.b.)    as long as Mr.T is not affected in living comfortably time to research is on your side.c.)    when the expert (vet) says lets try this for a little while or that next you do just as well finding a solution and learning results of different choices on your own or maybe even better by yourselfc at a much lower rate of expense.If the vet were ethical and honest and interested they would engage w/ you in your research learning the results of different choices as a passion and not charge for them standing over your shoulder w/ a white coat !  (or pink in some cases :)  But as you may have found an ethical businessman in the distant past there are few and far between these days.I am keeping MrT Buddyc Mokey and you in my thoughts and prayers ! :)   I love your channel (although I didnt watch the 2 recent videos of chains and bridles growing into the face videos ...... just makes me quizzy) and the rapport between your animal friends themselves and w/ you ! :)Steph_Louisiana

RedLeopardVideos,1627900,17:20 triggers me XDI understand the gengar comparison thats good x3 buuuut you also compared it to being lazy and horrible sooo I wanna teach you somethign cool about the shiny sprites in pokemon from 2nd gen to even 5th gen. They dont pick or design them the game runs a program when the conditions whatever they may be in the respective game are met to be a shiny. The spriting system runs a pallet swap to the closest color pallets that match shading defaults. this is why a lot of pink pokes ended up blue and why mew and ditto have that theory crafted shiny to normal theory and this is why quagsire swampert and wailord all turn pink its the program running the next closest set of colors that fits shader defaults which happens to be pink.Hope you learned something cool about spriting so if you see shiny you dont like dont call out gamefreak as having horrible design choice unless its 6th gen and up then those shinies are actually designed.

Lalalover 4ever,2071679,Firstly:Id like to point out how you say that it was not made to say you didnt need criticism when in fact you choose to force out any criticism given. If you really appreciated feedback you would take the criticism and put it to good use. Not throw it away like used napkins and scold the person giving it to you.Secondly:Your OC is not terrible. I see so many people bashing you about that when the truth of the matter is that they can and cant be wrong. In some aspects a few things here and there can be a little weird but otherwise Rainbow Splash is not a bad character regarding her design. Ill be making a video soon about her in fact. Only constructive criticism. No bashing.

Osmun Reptiles,1705977,Congrats on the baby and gorgeous baby snakes! I saw some of those on Morph Market and I was thinking the same thing that I wish the Firefly Calico was a female. He is a beauty. I love the high white ones and he has blushing too which is really nice. If I didnt have limited funds I would probably have picked that one up and the Firefly Woma Lesser possible het Clown that you showed with all the nice vertebral pattern and contrast. That GHI possible Chocolate is really pretty too with her banding.

Shamama Hunting Owl,28851,Hi there. Sending so much love and gratitude to you Christine and all on this journey It has been challenging this is for sure The only way to get to a place of calmness is to do your healing work. I have had many sessions with Christine and she always gets me back on track  😊the biggest message I get from the universe at the moment is “ you are the love you seek “ there for when I stopped looking outside of myself for acceptance and love and went within things started to move along.It’s hard to drop the expectations of how you want the situation to pan out we cling to it so hard. Let go and surrender. Know that with love and gratitude in your heart your future is bright no matter what it looks like. Xxx

Se tivesse dinheiro a fartura apostava na tua carreira mas ainda vou acompanhar os teus passos e quem sabe um dia se consiga patrocínio pra prosseguires na tua carreira musical.

When people ask about handling I simply ask back Would you hold your pet fish (betta) and walk around with it?    Its the same premise.  Not  every animal/plant is meant for handling!

HammyLux,1148408,I just purchased my first hamster baby. His name is smore because of his beautiful coloring and I would have to say I am absolutely in love. Hes so sweet and loves every toy that I place in his cage. I only have one question to hammy are anyone else can feel absolutely free to answer. I have a 3 story cage for my hamster that he absolutely loves but he is constantly knocking his shavings all on my floors so does anyone have any recommendations on what I can put around the cage to prevent this from happening and that is also safe for him?

Taylor Nicole Dean,1572771,i actually fell for this crap when i was like 11 got a little baby turtle from a flea market that was barely an inch the little thing still had her egg tooth never told me anything about it except he did say that it cant stay in the little blue island container he gave. but anyway being 11 i couldnt get everything that was totally necessary for little shippo my mom got the tank the gravel the little single floating island that shippo couldnt even get up on and the heater i kept telling mom she couldnt get up on the thing she refused to beleive me we ended up letting her go in the swamp/lake near my house as much as i begged her not to and told her it was actually illegal around here she didnt care. we do have red ears up here but she wouldnt hear any of it. shes still in that lake too we see her from time to time. but anyway yeah she was not happy at all when i had her for as much i tryed to take care of her so much cleaning tank a lot cause it wasnt filled more than like 4 inches of water and this was like a 40 gallon or maybe 30 but still. poor little shippo had a crap life untill the lake what else could an 11 year old do with out her parents to help and refusing to listen that shit wasnt right. yeah dont impulse buy animals in general its not going to be good for them unless you are 100% committed to caring for this real living creature to the absolute best for as long as they live. serously though you buy an animal they NEED you to care for them they cant do it on their own.

Tony Reed,2402443,HAL - You seem completely oblivious. Im typing utter nonsense here describing your conventional (plate tectonics based) explanation. None of these processes are even remotely possible. You believe that rivers and wind are sufficient to carry MILES THICK blankets of sediments deposited EVERYWHERE on the earths surface? What is the % of the surface covered by rivers in any single year? Less than 1%?Oceanic crust gets renewed? How? And if your model is to make any sense - why is this renewal taking place perpendicular to a crack which wraps around the globe? Convection currents rise in circular plumes as evinced by boiling mud porridge oats or anything which is heated up from beneath including land based volcanoes (all of which are circular) with magma coming up through GRANITE CONTINENTS. Wouldnt there be circular mounds bubbling up everywhere on the sea-floor instead of this crack?How did this crack form? When did it form?You do realize this crack also has perpendicular cracks which section it off into compartments; that this sea-floor spreading selectively avoids longitudinal directions relative to the main fault? Why?  How did the first plate subduct? How did the process begin and how can it continue? Subduction is absolutely impossible.How did Granite continents appear? Since theyre not sitting on the mantle as you said... oh wait you contradicted yourself they are sitting on the upper mantle the very part that according to your science delivers molten rock convectional currents.Why are all of the granite continents coated in miles thick layers of fossil filled sedimentary rock? Were they once under the oceans too?What happens when these blobs of granite encounter subduction zones? Do they subduct too?And please... do explain how lithification can give way to malleability!  Also explain how or why wet sediments uplifted by the millimeter per year dont have enough time to lithifify in open air and if you say they get eroded then how can you have sedimentary rock on the surface anywhere? Your explanation is completely unacceptable. ...Oh and please do forgive me. Im actually quite busy and dont really have that much time to respond. Please bear with me.BTW. What happened to the rest of the thread? Surely it hasnt been deleted?
Westie House,2391035,I actually thought of a question after the one about their coats. My sister has two boy Westies and their beardy bits around their mouths are always sort of dark compared to their coats...which are like cotton candy puppy fluff. Do you know if thats common for Westies or are my sisters wee boys just a pair of mucky faced pups?

I wanted to ask if you can make a video or if you have any training tips to prevent your dog from going near rattlesnakes or any dangerous poisonous animals.

Mr. Max T.V.,409402,Such a purdy birdie. Im glad you dont clip his wings. I know he is too big to really fly any in the house but still it just feels a little wrong to clip their wings. I never clipped my cockatiels wings but they were so small they could fly around the house without hurting themselves even though it was rare that they would. If I am ever fortunate enough to be able to properly care for a bird the size of Max I think I would try to get them used to a harness. I know the reasons you dont take Max outside though (temperature among other things). Im not commenting on that. I think you are a wonderful owner.

Think Like A Horse,2181776,Hey Rick...a Range Rover advertisement popped up on this video. How poshy! YouTube analytics must think you are popular with the elite equestrian Range Rover crowd. Range Rover is a huge supporter/sponsor of horse shows. The very people/events you cant stand. Tally Ho...just thought youd like to know. Oh. great analysis here...its unbelievable how horrid some horse trainers are. Anything for a buck.

Aquarium Co-Op,1404769,I see you employ the same method of softening hose-ends as I... Good move! Ive done it in a pot on a stove-top placing garder-hose ends on braided-vinyl hose for canisters. I also used soft clear vinyl hose in the installation of the sponge on my AquaClear-50s inlet... But I slipped (pushed) it over the outer-end of the elbow and pushed the other hose-end into the up-tube of a Aquatop Classic sponge--no boiling water involved! And when I needed it to be longer I either cut another length of hose or: Used the smaller up-tube from a Top-Fin under-gravel filter kit.

My wife and I both have lots of experience with them and would love the opportunity to raise one of the little babies and share with the world the progress and to show just how amazing they can be.

Think Like A Horse,642943,Sickening.  Would LOVE to tie her to a rope and whip the crap out of her but by human standards that would be considered cruel and unusual punishment.  I worked with horses for years and NEVER used a whip for training/punishment. Forty years ago at age 16 I broke a Mustang I adopted.  Took many months of patience...trained him to a hackamore; never had a bit in his mouth.  He was the best horse I ever had.  Keep up the good work teaching us Rick!!!
CatAleah,2384631,Great job indeed! I also wanted to confront pocket pets after I learned about them after rescuing my first one. I instantly searched for a reputable breeder for a buddy for her. Then I researched (pocket pets will tell you NOT to read other sources other than theirs?! There was no support online or by phone as they said there would be always be someone available for any concerns.... Wrong!! When I finally connected by phone (I’m persistent) the person barely spoke English. Bad outfit. If there comes a time that this were to happen in my area may I use your flyer? It’s very well done with the graphics and info. The large sugar glider is eye catching. Great job on the flyer as well and what an amazing way you handled yourself! I personally would have told him off after flicking the glider in the head!! But your way is much more productive. You showed great strength that I don’t know I could do the same. So with your flyer in hand and not just stating information by my own opinions. I’ll gladly share your info and help shut down or bring to light the truth about Gliders. Thanks for sharing!

He is SO precious and seems like a sweetheart! ❤️ Oh my goodness his white chin and paws too! 😍 I really hope his eye will heal up okay. Its sad to think he was back there for so many months. 😭 Although you werent able to get the Syrian gal you initially planned on it definitely sounds like this hamster was in need of a home and he must be in heaven in that terrarium! Glad you get to put it to use after all! For a name idea I was trying to think of something that went with Mochi so.....what about Haribo?

Очень интересно послушать ваше мнение по этому поводу в том числе способы коррекции неправильного поведения. Я думаю у многих есть такая проблема и людям будет интересно об этом послушать.

I missed her so much and I still do. Watching dog videos help me through this tough ride i have been on lately. I may have been with my dog for only 12 years but I havent seen her her whole life. You have spent time with your adorable Shiloh for his/her whole life. And I hope you guys will forever keep him/her in your hearts. <3 <3 (I have just subscribed to you and I choose on having a husky as my next forever dog but that will happen in a very long time.)

Cockatoo Luck,939605,Hello ES Sal and of course Joseph. My neighbour has a small parrot and I have been whistling back and forth with him when his window is open.Yesterday he was outside sitting on her shoulder and I was able to visit with him. She let me hold him on my finger for a few minutes. She was telling me all about the care and I was thinking of all you have to do for Joseph. Even though her bird Jinx is  much smaller than Joseph the care is still similar. The showers the nail  trimming the beak trimming. She doesnt clip his wings all the time and he flew away into the bushes over the weekend. Now we have two hawks in our area so Jinx will have to stay inside the gazebo instead of sitting on the deck rail until the hawks move on. Thank you for all the lessons I have learned about parrot care while watching Cockatoo Luck.

Side Hustle Pros,2272525,Just home from work. Saw this in my subscription feed for Side Hustle Pros and just finished watching and says it was streamed 8 hours ago. Yet the offer is ending in less than an hour and it is 1:17am Eastern Time.  I dont have any kind of scan app other than the Amazon seller APP and was wanting to get something soon. However there is not even time to search for information about the offers before they expire. Is this correct or is this demo and explanation going to be featured on another platform. I feel like I am missing out as I currently cannot afford the big ticket monthly prices for some of the other scan apps. Thanks

camelsandfriends,1405591,When I was a child I had a dog with whom I could play VERY rough with.  We were best of friends.  He was a medium-sized dog but I knew not to get anywhere close to him when he had a nice big meaty bone.  He was serious about that. ... And now YOU know.Lauren was giving you a lesson.  Thats all.  If he wanted to kill you youd be dead.Just reminiscing here:That dog o mine:  He was a great actor.  When we played rough his play in no shape form or fashion resembled play!  People watching it for the first time feared greatly for my safety.  Fifty years later I still miss him greatly.  He mustve been the smartest dog in the world too...Ooohh I could go on and on about him.I love you Ringo.  Its only (well almost only) because of you that I hope theres an afterlife.  I want us to be together again.

Think Like A Horse,1846186,You should get screen castimatics. Its a free program where you can record whats on your screen without a camera. It just records exactly what youre looking at and you can talk over it while youre recording. It might be better compared to recording a screen that recording a scene on a camera and then we have to watch it. I believe its a website if you want to check it out. Its kinda built for exactly these videos. Good luck!

CoralFish12g,2080177,Very awesome and inspirational. I personally like the look of floating shelves. To those who are wondering how he made it floating. It looks like the branch was epoxied to the glass and he used Tillandsia plants to hide the epoxy.
Cat Man Chris,44761,I know drawstring trousers and the like are wonderfully comfy but Chris I really hope you keep your strings tied when you wear them. Having loose dangling cat-toys hanging right in front of your bits...not a good idea~  >_o

꼬부기아빠 My Pet Diary,62640,꼬부기를 보고있기만해도 먹먹해지고 안쓰러운데 아빠엄마집사님은 표현하기 어려울 정도로 힘드시겠죠.. 그만큼 꼬부기가 집사님들에겐 어떠한 존재인지 알고있기에 더 마음이 아픈 것 같아요.. 아픈와중에도 너무 예쁜 꼬부기라고 말씀하시는데 눈물이 나네요.. 아빠집사님이 하신 말씀처럼 모두가 한마음으로 바라면 다 이뤄질거라고 생각합니다. 그 기도와 응원들이 꼬부기를 더 나빠지지않게 온전하게 건강하게 만들어줄거에요. 제가 해드릴 수 있는건 고작 말뿐이지만 그래도 조금이나마 힘이되고싶어 글만 구구절절 쓰게 되네요. 집사님들도 건강 잘 챙기시고 꼬부기랑 쵸비 모두 건강하게 행복하게 오래오래 함께 할 수 있기를 진심으로 바랍니다. 하루에 몇번씩 꼬부기 건강해지라고 기도 많이 할게요. 사랑스러운 꼬부기에게 언제나 행운이 가득하길...

Dan Hiteshew,1980219,Everything looks excellent! The t-bar did do a great job aquascaping. I agree it looks good.  As far as your moss turning red no worries on that- I have rotala indica that turns pink at the tips as it gets closer to the light (without dosing any iron). I imagine your moss is just getting more light than it usually would and is showing more vibrant colors because of that. It looks very healthy.

The Dodo,387486,The thumbnail is hilarious Im crying
Brian Barczyk,1713482,Dont let anyone effect your positivity. Ever since I found your videos a few weeks ago I watch them everyday. Im definitely in love with reptiles but never had a chance to actually own one. Mainly because of where I live. So as soon as I get out of the parents place I will be getting a reptile. Of course after a lot of research. Keep doing yall love you guys. And you definitely inspire me a lot with a positive attitude and handling snakes more
The Dodo,352660,visiting his friends at pet store you mean because dogs have the primal instinct of wanting to chase and catch smaller animals (for prey) and get excited when they see one. Dogs are absolutely great but people need to actually see them as how they are and not what seems cuter?

Brave Wilderness,589835,you can turn a crawfish blue fairly easy.   if you cut out carotene from it food completely and keep it out when it is young or before it sheds though it takes a few times for that to happen.  I did this a few years ago.   it can also happen if there is not enough aquatic plants.

The Dodo,911075,thank god for people like him. this appears to be a kemps Ridley sea turtle a small usually around 100 lb turtle a bit over two feet long. these turtles are extremely rare and the most critically endangered sea turtle with less than 40000 individuals existing and at one point were under a thousand nesting sites (from 40000 nests before just in Mexico). losing just one particularly a female can affect the entire population.  bravo. this guy is lucky to even be able to see one of these beautiful and reclusive creature

Info Marvel,995262,Pues si hicieron bien en no decirles todo a los actores para que no nos espoleen en las redes (aunque pueden negociar eso para que no digan nada).Y siento que fue buena estrategia para que a si todo el publico estemos emocionados en saber lo que pasara y a si iremos al cine a verla para ver que es lo que pasa y ganan mas para que la audiencia cuando la este viendo todo el rato no digan (a si esto ya lo sabiamos por lo que nos filtraron) y nos emocionemos por cada sorpresa que nos den.Esa es mi opinion no se que pienses tu Info Marvel de mi opinion.

Snowflakenice2 AJ,1498683,Honestly you guys dont know the full story of snowyskyz Cristiecrystal went undercover over snowy and faded she figured out they were growing onto her as buddies she thought she could trust them to see if they would scam a fellow scammer (she did not scam any of the items after the scammers gave her the items she would give it back you should ask herowolf999) And she trusted them and it seemed to be going well with snowy faded didnt want anything to do with her so snowy finally scammed her and they came back together and he got her a red long back but faded and snowy was having problems and faded scammed snowy and snowy quit for a few days snowy thought he or she could trust                   fadedstorms by them sharing a pink head dress so he gave up a black short and a long he asked for crystals green long and she obviously said no after he scammed her and faded wouldnt give up the head dress she said that was my hard earned rares for this hd this just goes to show you that scammers get what they get. so in the end she got scammed. of her dream item. -Luctisstars I dont support her in any way that was stupid for her to scam in the first place and it hurt many of my friends.

Brian Barczyk,1314100,So like I said before I started watching your videos because Mary from supermaryface was in your videos and she gets her snakes from you well some of them and I already have a leopard gecko named Ricky but Ive really been thinking about buying another gecko from you and possibly if I can get my dad and my son to agree because my dad is my roommate but my son doesnt like snakes or lizards and Ive had Ricky for over two and a half years and he never holds him so Im not sure how well my 16 year old son will do with a snake in the house but I just wanted to let you know that if I buy them I will definitely want to buy one from you I really loved that black gecko with the white stripe down its back oh my gosh that was so beautiful from yesterdays vlog but I definitely wanted to show you my geckos enclosure when I got him he only had two wooden homes and now Ive created a whole habitat for him and hes very happy anyways I love your videos its so awesome how much you love animals and love your family I just love what you do and I love your videos and you and your family

LeeMack912 Cigar McClain,922625,Mr Leemack your story hit home let me tell you what happened to me a few months ago. Crown Heads was putting on a cigar show at one of our cigar shops here. I went to it on a saturday nite i got cleaned up went i was looking pretty good starched cotton shirt nice slacks and my stacy adams i was talking with the guy from crown heads he was telling me about the cigars he was promoting we had a good conversation going. All of a sudden this older white gentlemen bump in to me he was older than i was im 57 he was about 65 so he bumped into me i said excuse me because i thought i got in his way but he kept trying to move me out from where i was the guy from crown heads told him sir i will be with you in a moment and do you know what that sucker said its not like buying BBQ the man from crownheads looked at me because i was getting ready to go off on this older guy for saying what he said but then i checked myself and all i said was dont you feel stupid and i looked him right in his eyes letting him know dont say nothing else the guy from crown heads just shooked his head and told the old man that was uncalled for  for him to say that and that i had every right he had to be there. I just walked off later the guy from crowned heads came and apologized for the old man and made me a hell of deal on a box of La Imperiosa cigars and said all of us white folks are not so stupid. But i told that story because i know what it feel like for people treat you like you dont belong in a certain place or what are you doing here if he would have caught me about 30 years ago i would have handed him his ass. Have a good rest of your week i wasnt going to add to his ignorance i could have acted a fool but i checked myself he ended up looking stupid

Brave Wilderness,1520983,I love the Brave Wilderness Chanel because it has always been a dream of mine to explore around the world and see everything there is to see. To be honest I have never left the country and haven’t been to too many states I would love to see London France Brazil and pretty much everywhere I can. If I were to win I would give the pack to my grandpa because I love exploring caves and trails with him in Payson Arizona. I feel the pack would allow him my little cousin and I to explore longer.
Brave Wilderness,1991126,So when you boil it does it turn orange or nah?
Brian Barczyk,81331,Brian I think almost all of us if not all of us can relate to loving pets we have and getting emotional when they are sick or have anything bad happen to them!Never feel like you have to hide things because frankly it shows u r not only human but tells me that all the haters claiming u dont treat your animals well are simply full of shit! I think we all just want Artie to get better and if the time comes that you end up having to do the hard thing although the right thing we will still be here for you and also if you need to not vlog for a day or two then do iti know that is something you would rather not do either but its cool man we UNDERSTAND! Just do what u need to Brian and I will keep Artie in my thoughts! never worry about what little backlash u would get from anyone here because they dont matter! Just be yourself man! Anyways i hope the day gets better for Lori and you and Noah and especially Artie! Anyways now i am going to go watch you cut open these eggs and see these twins you have!!! Never even knew that twins with snakes were possible :)

Travis Heinze,59785,dont even talk to this guy he is rude and unappreciative at best at worst a tinfoil hat (modified magnet infused) sanctimonious cowardly  scaramouch .....travis is never wrong even after admitting to possesition of child porn videos of young boys on his personal computer and a police raid and subsequent arrest.baited into explaining that arrest by his trolls Good ole whistle tongue Travis Heinze made a 15 minute youtube video explaining that the evidence and charges were true and correct but he is not to blame and there were no victims (even tho the pre-pubescent  boys in the video were being raped by adult men) and that he would do it again if given the chancewell he was given the chance in 2015 he opened his first YouTube channel AccuMagnet that was supposed to be dedicated to building tinfoil hats with the modifier of dozens of rare earth magnets placed inside the layers of tinfoil at specific polarity and aligned with the lumps in his headonly travis heinze accumagnet channel was quickly taken down by youtube for sexual exploitation of children under the age of 10 for monetary gain .... travis heinze was secretly video taping pre-pubescent boys and girls at the beach and in public bathrooms using his camera hidden in his bag and iphone held over bathroom stalls and posting his perverted pedophile videos to accumagnet and monetizing!neer–do–well travis heinze sexualizes 8 year old girls digging sand castles masterbates to 10 year old boys urnating drools while secretly videotaping up 9 year old girls skirts at the supermarket with his video camera hidden in a shopping bag and posted all this to his monetized accumagnet youtube channel.The YouTube community came united front very quickly upon discovering these abhorrent uploads by the goldbricking travis heinze. Many stalwart YouTubers such as myself and many others reported that AccuMagnet channel and Travis Heinze thru the flagging system and that awful foul degenerate and criminal channel was quickly removed from YouTubes servers and forwarded to the federal controlling authorities for additional criminal investigation.For standing up to this reprobate travis heinze and his self described child porn addiction i am now labeled a hater his well intentioned but uninformed fan-boys attack me and others steadfast as i am against depraved child hurting monsters the likes of travis heinze i forgive his ignorant fan-boys for they know not what they do.candle ice you are right about the title right about bum signals right about disrespecting the dead but no matter the common sense arguments plain as day evidence school boy logic you bring to travis heinze he is right even if he is wrong and thats all there is too itjust look a few days ago how he doc dropped his own mother on social media here on youtube facebook and instra....he dragged all the family skeletons out for the world to see blogging posting and video responses to his elderly sick and lonely that were nothing but harmful distortions hateful fabrications stammering falsehoods shifty eyed attacks on not involved family members (i am trying to protect the innocent) and dodgeable deflections of his (travis heinze) mean and un American behavior towards his loving old and frail mother and other close family and blood relationsall his mother was trying to do was reach out to travis heinze with a invitation to return to family home and unconditional forgiveness for past differences as well as a message of motherly love and travis heinze went into beast mode unleashing on  all levels of social media bringing up insignificant and very personal family things from 5 years 10 15 20 even stuff from 46 years ago and throw into his mothers face with a big fuck youthis travis heinze is not homeless he is bull baiting his loving family by embrassing them with his human shiting in resedental neighborhoods eating rotted food picking the smallest mosquito bite with 3 years unwashed hands until he has hot abscess publically posting child porn public postings of police encounters wearing the same clothes for 4 years without changing or laundering not any personal hygiene for 4 years at all brushing teeth with a chunk of copper wearing tinfoil cap with magnet modifier kicked out of libraries due to smelling up the building lurking in public restrooms refusing work on grounds of he has size 29 shoes and therefor cannot get gainful employment as no one is allowed to work barefoot 3 days later buys and wears shoes just cuz....all this grandiose victimhood just to embarrass and shame his dear mother and other close family....you wanna talk screw loosehe has a nice etrade account from his step fathers estate of over a quarter of a million as does his caring mother and siblings yet travis felt it wise to post that hateful bully video last week about how his step dad relationship with his birth mother caused him to have sexual feelings and incest forcible touching of vulnerable young sister thru her grade school years and general confused romantic-sexual dominance towards his sisters all through childhood and even to today.TRAVIS HEINZE ALSO HAS SAVINGS CHECKING ACCOUNTS HAS A CAR BUYS TECHNOLOGY AS NEEDED HE EVEN CARRIES VISA AND MASTERCARDS IN HIS POCKET LIKE SO MANY NICKLES THE RECEIPTS CAN BE SEEN IN THE VIDEO HE EAT A WENDYS POTATOgo search his few remaining channels for the crazy and hateful stuff he posts about random prepubescent children his siblings his departed step father his loving mother Mrs. Heinze blacks women mexicans asians cops (he failed his psych exam on his police test as a young man in his mind that screwed him for life) fat ladys nursing home workers...go ahead  do your researchTravis also has about hundred sock accounts here on youtube one can often find travis in heated arguments with himself in the comment section cinnamon life gregory simmons any user name with phd or md attached julie moncreif ckaoo7 rabbithopx and a million others its how he ups his view count and creates appearance of spirited debate in comment section....its als why he lost his adsense for life due to fraud scam clicks from one ip address (same hundred sock accounts from a different library parking lot IP address)....how did that scam work out for ya travis heinze?accept your mommys forgiveness and ask her for forgiveness for your numerous and harmful transgressions and go home and care for your ageing and frail mother her days are short on this earthso call he a hater cus i stand up for good Mrs Heinze over travis call me a hater for standing up for raped childern that dont have a voice call me a hater for calling travis heinze out of upskirting schoolgirls at the mall for calling travis heinze out for secret videoing little girls at beach and posting to a monetized YouTube channel owned by himself and putting keywords to attract the pervert clicks...how sick is that and that was only 2015  a few years ago his child porn arrest 2012 his last bath 2013 his last change of clothes 2013 his fight with his mother? right after the child porn bust when he wouldnt go to counseling instead choosing to hit the road and continuing his perverted quest of vulnerable childrentravis heinze if this truth makes you feel some feelings....dont seek your mothers forgiveness...just put your majik magnet modified tinfoil cap on.....atta boy!

I do use a bit on him for dressage only-I hate using it but as I have mentioned before dressage has not moved out of the stone ages. And yes I do jump him. I enjoy it. He does his job without protesting. After arena work we hit the trails. He is becoming a damn good trail horse.

Vet Ranch,1810416,People WTF?! Dr. Matt is only trying to say that when the dog wakes up he wont look like a normal male dog. He wasnt literally trying to say that the dog would be a female when it wakes up. And the hate that these videos get its amazing. That people can dislike a video of people helping abandoned and abused animals. Seriously. Trying to challenge a vets knowledge compared to yours on the topic of this video is frustrating and very annoying.

Brave Wilderness,623854,Coyote if you feel bad about breaking a camera. Ive broken a bong with an air carbonator. (Idk how thats actually spelled). As well as a Chillum and a .25g bowl. I know this is all of topic with me speaking about marijuana products but the simple fact that Im clumsy with the simplest stuff so I can relate in a way with you on how you expressed yourself on breaking the cameras. The guilt is strong lol but dont worry. Its all material world stuff we are all vibrations. 😎

Steff J,985122,Heres my turtle story.I am an avid animal lover much like yourself. I saw this turtle trying to cross the road so I pulled over to try and help the turtle across. I was waiting for one single truck to pass by so I could walk across and pick up the turtle (mind you this turtle was about as big as Penelope) so I know this driver saw the turtle and he ran him over in purpose :(. Right in front of me! I cried. He didnt kill the turtle but he broke his back leg and cracked a little bit of his shell. I didnt know what to do and my mom wouldnt of allowed me to take him home so I waked him in the forest and placed him by a stream. Hopefully the little guy made it through i know reptiles recover from injuries fairly well. </3

Mr. X Dreams,601549,Good Evening Mr.X Dreams. Ive had experiences with sleep paralysis. Ive had cancer twice. during my first round of cancer treatments it started    and was horribly intrusive as cancer is I constantly felt as if there was an entity always around that I had no idea of why it came to be so intense.after2 years I went into remission and as I was healing it started to get better. almost totally ceased. 4 years later I was diagnosed again and my treatments were more aggressive and the paralysis returned.I started wondering was it because I was between life and death. To say it is scary is an understatement! It totally makes you question your sanity and at the same time seems to make you more aware of the unspoken and unknown. anyway I so thank you for sharing these experiences and a great collaboration !

Solid Gold Aquatics,669115,Hi Jennifer.  I have been moving my Orandas to an outdoor pond every summer for years.  That algae youre showing looks a lot like string algae that I see in my pond unless I use an ultraviolet algae scrubber.  I bring my fish in during the winter and Ive a couple of times where it will crop up in my aquarium.  If I see it I typically throw the scrubber in the for a few days and it clears it right up.  My 2 cents is that youre dealing with string algae. That said I really love your Dumbo betta!  So much so that Im going to get one for myself.  And I love that Fluval Spec aquarium. I want to see if they come in larger sizes. I always learn to much from you.  Thanks.

pastorbobncc,1714843,The precession of the equinoxes takes 72 years to complete one degree but each section of the precession has a constellation for that age. Now we are entering the dawning of the age of Aquarius. The fascinating thing about this is it takes 25920 years to make a complete revolution but ancient writings on structures have displayed the builders knowledge of these facts! This information can cause one to loose their religion.

Rachel Oleary,45018,Hey Rachel weird question here but I recently stocked a new 15 gallon tank with 4 dwarf gouramis 2 longfin rams 2 corys and a bristlenose pleco. Noticed some aggression between the gouramis and rams during the first 2 days but they have seemed to mellowed out a bit now. Just wanted your input on whether or not these fish are all completely safe to keep together or if I need to halve their numbers into a new tank. Dont want to see any of them die theyre all gorgeous!Album of Tank & Fish : http://imgur.com/a/R4ib1

Knowledge Feed,1309754,gf
MARLENE MCCOHEN,1333069,Just an FYI Galah Cockatoo is inaccurate. They are simply called a Galah. Yes they are a member of the cockatoo family but so are cockatiels. Calling this bird a Galah Cockatoo is the same as if you were going around calling cockatiels Cockatiel Cockatoos. Galahs are also known as Rose-Breasted Cockatoos so perhaps there was some confusion between the two common names for them.That being said all your parrots are lovely and I enjoy watching them. Keep up the great work.

askcliffe,2052566,Atheists often think its a possibility argument there is a possibility we came into exist by chance and then atheists say well its possible!! but its actually an argument of probability based on the evidence available and what we have experienced in our lives is it more probable that the universe happened by chance from nothing along with all the order and design we know is there? (DNA irreducible complexity) or is it more probable that an intelligent Being created the universe and the order and design we see are a result of His mind? Not to mention the fact that the odds of chance are mind blowing based on that fact alone an intelligent Being definitely seems more probable. Just as if someone was playing poker and they get 50 royal flushs in a row there is a chance it could happen but the probability is that they are cheating based on the evidence and my experience.

Taylor Nicole Dean,334101,Just keep going it’s hard to do but it helps in the long run. I’ve had depression on and off since I was 13 (am now 30) and I know how hard normals things are to do. You feel you can’t do stuff but if you avoid what is hard for you everything eventually gets worse. I struggled for a while as there is no one who would be significantly affected if I were no longer here. I now have guinea pigs and I know that they would suffer if were not around.

Pickles12807,605366,Everyone saying that these reptiles are in tiny boxes for display only is laughable. These animals should still have access to water and a place to hide whether on display or not. And let’s face it these animals are not held or relocated every evening. Get real. What store owner/workers have time for that. This treatment should be illegal. I’m glad we have strict animal laws in the UK.

The Dodo,629732,I snorted
Viktor Larkhill,1138114,Ok. I am officially disgusted that people online are so gullible and stupid. This channel constantly makes up ridiculous claims about how the dogs came to be hurt always to provoke the most outrage. This dog could have been run over by a vehicle (thats exactly how the injury looks). Further it was obvious it should have been humanely euthanized immediately rather than used for clickbait and the moneymaking scheme going on here. For shame.
Brave Wilderness,466711,Not gonna lie I think it was more curious than scared O-o Its like after a bit it just went Meh he seems friendly enough. I wonder what his face smells like. *Sniff sniff*

Shamama Hunting Owl,239364,Holy shit. You sure did deliver a powerful message. This past week has been a rocky one thats for sure. I had moments of self doubts and episodes of anxiety and agressivity like I havent had in a good while now. It was scary for a moment to feel these strong emotions again. But I feel like I am now back on track wich is such a relief. Im ready for the next challenges - bring it on resistance.Thank you for reassuring me in moments of self-doubt and uplifting me even higher even when I am already feeling in alignment.Love

Brave Wilderness,1917612,Those stings on the lips... theres only one place that could be worse man... To be honest I see this as harder than a lot of the single stings from last year. With those you only have to apply it once and youre committed even if its more painful overall it doesnt require such force of will as holding a swarm of stinging bees on your face.

Brave Wilderness,898435,Hey coyote can you handle the daddy long legs in Australia. The daddy long legs is the most venomous spider in man kind but there venom does physically NOTHING to humans as there teeth are square and not strong enough to penetrate the human skin. They cant even penetrate 1 layer of skin. Can you purposely get yourself bitten by one to prove to everyone there harmless? Then you have bragging rights that you got bitten by the most. Venomous spider on earth and there will be no antidote required. Like so coyote can see

Rise Up Society Fan Page,629834,Good that you are trying I do honestly mean that.Why does he move around so randomly picking here and there missing  jiggers occasionall? Why not clear away the  top layer of say 10/20  at a time then go clean them all out and then repeat the process again and sticking to the same area until you have worked your way along to next area. This  surgeon is far too slow and this erratic technique is the reason. Why doesnt the teacher read my comment and then you can teach the volunteers the correct way. And scalpels are much easier to control connected to the handle they were made for You have far greater control and power increase without having your fingers aching and hurting .

Lilly Bell Looks,335671,Hello! I saw your video in the recommended of another video about sugar gliders. It seems theres a couple (Ive seen 2 in about 15m) who think bringing sugar gliders around in tiny pouches to school and restaurants and such is okay. I dont know much on sugar gliders so I was wondering what your opinion is on this? In one of the videos I saw they fed it breaded chicken and some of the comments said that seasoning is dangerous to sugar gliders. The videos I watch the posters ignore the comments saying how theyre putting the animal in danger yet continue to do it.

Cat Man Chris,25932,I love this Kudos to you for taking on these sweet victims. It takes a lot of patience and a special kind of love to deal with this kind of heartache and with what wonderful results!I would encourage people to adopt these beautiful furbabies. It is an amazing thing to see them grow and learn what love is!I have a gorgeous blue-eyed Siamese/orange tabby who was born into a colony of cats that was tended by a hoarder. She put food out in buckets but that was all the care they ever got... they roamed the property around the complex reproducing like mad but the woman ended up in a nursing home. It was a horrible situation heavy traffic all around and not enough small prey to keep that many alive. Whenever one died they would actually eat each other!... SO sad..   A neighbor called local animal control and they rounded up all but three of the sixty plus cats... that was before I moved in. My little friend Amigo was one of the three and terrified of people with good reason. Before I managed to get him inside he was used as target practice for kids with rocks and sticks and by one young punk with a handgun.  It took a long time to earn his trust... Weve moved since a quieter place. He still doesnt like visitors but he lives completely indoors now with plenty of hiding places and for me he is the sweetest little boy ever loves to cuddle on the bed and plays tag with my other two rescues.

Gone to the Snow Dogs,2256026,#AskGTTSD I have a big problem. My dog is afraid of harnesses. Whenever we take it out she runs away. She pulls a lot and has minor tracheal collapse so we cant walk her by the collar. We got a new one and tried introducing it to her. Shes not afraid of it when it doesnt touch her but when it touches her she cowers and runs away. She is comfortable being around it and touching it. What can we do to desensitize her to it? She is an afraid dog in general if that helps.

Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel,1741955,Hey Hope for Paws. What you do is amazing! I was hoping you could rescue some dogs near where my mom works which is in South LA. There are so many dogs running around the projects and streets that get abused by adults and teenagers who do it just for fun. Please let me know if youd like a more specific location. Thanks!
Maddie Smith,1661149,I know this was posted yesterday but I just wanted to say I love your channel and all of your animals! I’m only 12 and struggle with severe anxiety and depression just watching your animals has helped me so much! Thank you for that. And I had a question:Would a 10 gallon be okay for a male Kenyan sand boa for its whole life? I don’t want it to be the minimum Or too small. I was just wondering since I already have a 10 gallon at home. Thanks!

Dogumentary TV,1999637,I know you said they are not great personal protection dogs but I respectfully disagree. My old late great Tarzan would have to be restrained when someone would so much as look at us sideways. He was a great dog and as freindly and loving as they get and he instinctively seemed to know the difference between a person with bad intentions and a person just walking past us. At 185 lbs. he was a scary situation if you moved to quick or looked suspicious but if you were cool stranger or not he would let you rub his belly and play with you. He had great personal protection traits without being a maniac....... but my oh my... if he didnt want you around you KNEW it.

RnW2011ccn,1966993,We couldnt see the extent of it is finished the earth quaked and the rock split at the foot of the Cross Christs blood was released by the Roman soldier who pierced his side. While Six hundred years earlier The Ark of the Covenant was moved.. Solomon prepared for its hiding and Jeremiah moved it precisely under the cross yet future!                    REVELATION 12.    THE WITNESS OF THE BLOOD IN THE STARS..17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.                                   The Rabbis keep the tablets of stone and                              the blood (testimony) found on the mercy seat.https://youtu.be/Irz8OtHWoJ8    1 3/4 minuteshttps://youtu.be/qAFtormiU_0     3 minuteshttps://youtu.be/CsjusN6VVko    56 minutesI will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourn for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.             ENMITY is what exists now the solution is in the Fathers witness! 1 John 5:8 And there are three that bear witness in earth the Spirit and the water and the blood: and these three agree in one.9 If we receive the witness of men the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. 10 He that believe on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believe not God hath made him a liar; because he believe not therecord that God gave of his Son. For it is by His grace we are rescued through faith; and this is not of yourselves but it is the gift of Elohim. (when opened). 9. Not of works or else anyone glory (in themselves). 10. For we are His creation who are created in Yshua the Mashiyach for good works which Elohim has before prepared for us to walk in. 11. Wherefore be mindful that you formerly were carnal Gentiles; and you were called the uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision of which is the work of the hands in the flesh.  12. And you were at that time without the Mashiyach; and were aliens from the Devarim of Israel; and strangers to the covenant of the promise; and were without hope and without Elohim in the world. 13. But now by Yshua the Mashiyach you who before were afar off have been brought near by the Blood of the Mashiyach. 14. He is Himself our peace who has made the two (become) ONE      <--- NO ONE TEACHES THIS !!                                 and has demolished the Wall which stood in the midst and the Enmity by his flesh. 15. And in his flesh (the) enmity and regulations of commands (contained) in his commandments are ABOLISHED that in himself he might make the two into ONE establishing peace. 16. And has reconciled BOTH with Elohim in one body and has slain the enmity by his stake (of execution).  31 Behold the days come saith the Lord that I will make anew covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: 32 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake although I was an husband unto them saith the Lord: 33 but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days saith the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts; and will be their God and they shall be my people. 34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying Know the Lord: for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more.

Brian Barczyk,2330870,please dont hate me for this and Im entitled to my own OPINION but I dont like this guy because he doesnt give all of his animals equal amounts of attention or not enough attention. these creatures need affection to be docile and tame but since he has like (I THINK) over 1000 reptiles its difficult. I just dont like most breeders who have like over 30 or 40 reptiles cause you cant give them all the same amount of attention. sorry but I just think its wrong.

Barrys Workshop,85382,You can also cut the collector on the Q6 transistor or remove or cut the 5.6K resistor tied to the Q6 collector on the MC-60 controller  and the unit will start and stop at the set speed with the main on/off switch.  No need for a separate switch.    The collector is the lead on the right looking at the flat face of Q6.  One more note the brushes are slanted or biased toward one direction rotation.  Running in reverse will cause excessive brush wear and lower torque.  Enjoyed the video.  I have one of these on my drill press and it works great.

Altitude Exotics,2116588,Ive never seen my crestie drinking standing water but Ive also never seen him licking water after Ive misted too. The shop I bought him from told me to feed him 2-3 crickets every time I replace his Pangea/repashy and Ive seen him literally stalking them and he goes to the floor of his cage to hunt them because he knows thats where they hide. He doesnt particularly like being handled either but thats my fault Ive not spent enough time taming him. Most of these misconceptions in this video are addressed in a lot of the care sheets Ive read and they debunk them tbh. The knowledge is getting better.

Scaly Stories,2285648,I am not against the state of Israel.  I am part jewish ethnically and am a Christian. However first and foremost we are the new Israel in the Lord Jesus.  The Lord taught that he could make sons of Abraham out of these rocks remember?  Further if you support the Jewish ethno state which is fine with me btw and I prefer them to the Islamists but you must be consistent and support a white ethno state for White Christian Europeans.  Do you?

Maverick mista majah p,2449438,It has nothing to do with being Black. I believe in the sanctity of the 1st Amendment. When Colin or any one else are in his civil attire at his own house or out and about he can say whatever he wants. But when he puts on the NFL uniform and present in a NFL stadium he becomes a voice of the NFL. This is no different than a police officer making a statement while in uniform a member of the military fire department etc. You tell me what would happen to a Major in the USMC in uniform who calls the President an a-hole on TV.

Corny (my boy) the older one nearly always strikes and wraps himself around the mouse.  I scream EVERY time he strikes! lolol

ViralHog,3525,They sold ths kid video for some 700 views.  Wow
The Dodo,833834,We dont beat my dog he just stands up on his own. We hold up a toy or a treat and say Axel come get it! And he jumps up. Hes still pretty young so if we keep doing this and encouraging it hell probably become better at it. But we dont beat him and he always gets lots of love. We didnt train him to do that he just likes jumping up. But anyone who would beat their dog is insane and just plain stupid for giving a dog or animal such a horrible life. Use encouragement and treats and love to train a dog not pain and abuse. Let them do what they want and if they dont do a trick that you want them to do who cares? Let them live their life how they want to no one beats you into doing what they want you to. So why do it to anyone else?

Brian Barczyk,2253947,I know exactly how you feel about your puppy. In a few months it will be 2 years since my dog passed of lung cancer. when you are surrounded by an animal or animals you create a strong bond to them. it is hard to see them in pain. You arent a baby you are a human who has emotions.
Steve Poland Aquatics,1059806,Hey Steve if I remember correctly you are on a well system and dont have to worry about treating your water that comes out of the tap. Have you thought about just hooking up a hose to where you have the bulb (maybe with a quick release connection) and prime the syphon then interrupt it with the ball valve disconnect the hose and restart like you did in the video. This would streamline it to a straight pipe except for the brief moment needed to prime the syphon.

Brother K,1384914,Well it may be racist. I have a feeling that circumcision is probably statistically more of a problem among White America than among minorities. But it does seem (according to this lady) that there is a tad bit more vulgarity and superstition (and a lot more willingness for circumcision confrontation) surrounding the foreskin than there is in the White community. In the White community which is all that I am familiar with people get weak in the knees faint suffer a blood pressure collapse and run the other way if the word foreskin or circumcision is uttered.  Middle class Whites would sooner DIE than have a public discussion about circumcision.﻿
